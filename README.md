# ðŸ§ˆ Mentega Text-to-Speech ðŸ§ˆ
### [Klik di sini untuk instruksi dalam Bahasa Indonesia](README_ID.md)
A simple Twitch Text-to-Speech with (very unreliable) multi language (ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© Indonesian, ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ English, and ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ Japanese) support! Please follow my Twitch at [https://www.twitch.tv/mentegagoreng](https://www.twitch.tv/mentegagoreng) if you want to see the TTS on action. _Or just follow me anyway. Seriously tho._

## Installation
This software runs on the browser, so you can either open the URL or add it to your OBS browser source. I personally prefer using OBS browser source since I can have more freedom to adjust the audio, such as setting the volume or the audio track.

1. Download the files from [here](https://github.com/mentegago/mentega-tts/releases/latest).
2. Unzip and open `index.html`.
3. Add this to **the end** of the URL:

````
#token={your oauth token}&username={your username}&channel={target channel}
````

4. Fill in the parameters with these values:

Parameters:
- `token`: Your oauth token. Get your token here: [https://twitchapps.com/tmi/](https://twitchapps.com/tmi/).
- `username`: Your username.
- `channel`: Channel to which the TTS will run on.
- (_Optional_) `hideNotifications`: set to `true` to hide notification message that shows up on top left corner of the screen.

The parameters are put in hash (`#`) instead of query (`?`) so you that your OAuth token never leaves the client (except to Twitch). That way, there's no worry of your OAuth token being logged by any server.

If you open the URL in your browser, do note that:
1. **You'll need to refresh the page** everytime you change any of the parameters as the software doesn't listen to window hash changes.
2. **You'll need to click on the page first** on most browsers, or else the audio will be blocked. You can mitigate this by allowing audio autoplay for the page.

## Not yet implemented
- TTS will always ignore chat that starts with exclamation mark (`!`). No option to disable this filtering yet.
- ~~TTS only read the message, not username.~~ TTS now reads username, however there's no way to disable this yet.
- TTS limits to only 200 characters per message.
- TTS chat queue limits to only 5 chats. If there are more chat entering the queue, it will remove the oldest one. No option to override yet.
- ~~When TTS is confused of which language to use, it will choose Indonesian voice as it's the most neutral one (sounds okay for both English and Japanese). No option to override it yet.~~ It will now just choose the most probable language between Indonesian, English, or Japanese.
- Indonesian, English, and Japanese only. Cannot add or remove any of them. Theoretically it's possible to add other languages, but I haven't implemented it yet. I don't think I'll be implementing it anytime soon.
